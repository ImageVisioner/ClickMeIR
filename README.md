**Note:**   

We utilize the global and local prior characteristics of small infrared targets and propose a level-set based truth annotation pipeline.

The manuscript has been submitted to IEEE SENSOR JOURNAL. All codes will be released after the manuscript is accepted.



**Results:** 

Compare the visualization results obtained from our method with different learning-based methods.Infrared small targets are emphasized and magnified by red rectangles.
