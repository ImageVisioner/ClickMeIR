**Note:**   

We utilize the global and local prior characteristics of  infrared  small  targets and propose a level-set based truth annotation pipeline.

The manuscript has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing . All codes will be released after the manuscript is accepted.



**Results:** 

Compare the visualization results obtained from our method with different learning-based methods.Infrared small targets are emphasized and magnified by red rectangles.

**Additional Expansion Packs**   
this platform implements the XML format export function for target detection tasks. Its core idea is to invert the minimum bounding rectangle of the target through level set evolution, thereby achieving pixel-level accurate positioning and annotation.

Furthermore, the annotated XML tool functions we provide are an extension package that is not only applicable to the method proposed in this article, but also suitable for converting masks generated by various level set methods into JSON/XML cultural formats supported by object detection.

**GUI SoftWare**   
We have designed an app using Maltab App Designer to help users quickly annotate. We will release our software after the manuscript is accepted.
