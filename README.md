**Note:**   

We utilize the global and local prior characteristics of small infrared targets and propose a level-set based truth annotation pipeline.

The manuscript has been submitted to Measurement . All codes will be released after the manuscript is accepted.



**Results:** 

Compare the visualization results obtained from our method with different learning-based methods.Infrared small targets are emphasized and magnified by red rectangles.

**GUI SoftWare**   
We have designed an app using Maltab App Designer to help users quickly annotate. We will release our software after the manuscript is accepted.
